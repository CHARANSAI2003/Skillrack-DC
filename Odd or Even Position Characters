The program must accept a string value S as the input. The program must print the characters which are present at the odd positions if the count of vowels in S is odd. 
Else the program must print the characters which are present at the even positions as the output. If there is no vowel in the string S then the program must print -1 as
the output.

Boundary Condition(s): 
2 <= Length of S <= 100

Input Format: 
The first line contains the string S.

Output Format:
The first line contains either the characters which are present at the odd or even positions or -1.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
apple

Output: 
pl

Explanation:
In the word apple, there are two vowels. Here the count 2 is even.
Hence the characters at the even positions are printed.
Hence the output is pl 

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
rhythm

Output: 
-1
