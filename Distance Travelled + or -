The program must accept a string S representing the direction of movement as the input. The string S contains only the characters + and -. A boy moves 1 unit left side if the character in S is -. The boy moves 1 unit right side if the character in S is +. The program must print the distance between the starting position of the boy and the final position at the end of the string as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 1000 

Input Format: 
The first line contains the string S. 

Output Format:
The first line contains the distance between the starting and final position of the boy.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input: 
-+++- 

Output: 
1

Explanation:
The first character is - so he moves 1 unit towards his left.
The second character is + so he moves 1 unit towards his right so he reaches the starting position again.
The third character is + so he moves 1 unit towards his right.
Now he is 1 unit away from the starting position.
The fourth character is + so he moves 1 unit towards his right.
Now he is 2 units away from the starting position.
The fifth character is - so he moves 1 unit towards his left.
Now he is 1 unit away from the starting position.
So the output is 1.

Example Input/Output 2: 
Input: 
+++++- 

Output:
4
