The program must accept a string S which contains only lower case alphabets as the input.The program must remove the consonants which are occurred consecutively. 
Then the program must print the modified string S as the output. Note: At least one vowel is always present in the string S. 

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100 

Input Format: 
The first line contains the string S.

Output Format: 
The first line contains the modified string value of S.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
elephants

Output:
elea

Explanation: 
The consonants p and h are have occurred consecutively so they are removed from the string "elephants".
Now the string becomes "eleants".
The consonants n t and s are occurred consecutively so they are removed from the string "eleants".
Now the string becomes "elea".
Hence the output is elea

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
